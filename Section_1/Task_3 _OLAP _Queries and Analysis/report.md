### *Task 3: OLAP Analysis Report*

The OLAP analysis of the retail data warehouse provides actionable insights into sales performance across countries and product categories. The **roll-up query** shows that the *United Kingdom* leads in total sales, followed by the *Netherlands*, *Germany*, and *France*. The top 10 countries collectively dominate the sales, with the UK alone contributing nearly \$6 million, highlighting a concentrated market focus in Europe.

The **drill-down query** for the United Kingdom indicates monthly sales patterns ranging from approximately \$355,000 to \$498,000 per month. These fluctuations suggest possible seasonal trends and provide guidance for inventory and promotional planning.

The **slice query** for the *Electronics* category reveals total sales of approximately \$12,869, which is a small fraction of overall revenue. This suggests that Electronics contributes minimally to the total sales, whereas categories like *Miscellaneous* or *Clothing* likely drive the bulk of revenue. This information can help prioritize marketing and stock allocation for high-performing product lines.

The **visualization of the top 10 countries** confirms that sales are heavily concentrated in a few key markets, with the UK and Netherlands clearly outperforming others. This emphasizes the need for targeted strategies in these regions, while identifying lower-performing markets such as Belgium and Sweden for potential growth opportunities.

Using synthetic data provides a realistic structure for analysis but may not capture real-world market dynamics or exact consumer behavior. Nonetheless, the data warehouse effectively demonstrates how OLAP operations—roll-up, drill-down, and slicing—support multi-level aggregation and detailed insights. These analyses enable informed decision-making regarding regional focus, product strategy, and revenue optimization.
